# Security Policy


## Reporting a Vulnerability

Jira is our entrypoint to report security vulnerabilities. Having this mind a KUNSECU user story (type Vulnerability) needs to be created. 

### How to fill the user story? 

Follow this [documentation](https://confluence.xing.hh/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=381133070).


### To which team do I assign the user story? 

Follow the [component ownership matrix](https://confluence.xing.hh/display/kununu/Component+ownership+and+support) and assign it to the corresponding team.


## Reporting the update of dependencies

This is the benefit of having Dependabot. It will open pull requests for security and version updates. For more information check the Github [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-pull-requests-for-dependency-updates).
